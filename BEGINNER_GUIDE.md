# Beginner Guide

So you own a Meta Quest (1, 2, or Pro) and you've never built and installed a Unity project on it? If yes, then follow the steps below!


## Verifying Your Oculus Developer Account and Creating an Organization

The first thing you need to do is verify your Oculus Developer Account. To do that, go to [this](https://developer.oculus.com/) website and log in with your Meta Account.

Next click on the `Verification` tab and verify your developer account by adding your credit card or setting up two-factor authentication.

Next go to [this](https://developer.oculus.com/manage/organizations/create/) page to create an organization.

Enter any name you want, agree to the terms of service and press the Submit button. You will then see a developer NDA pop-up. Agree to it and press the Submit button.

## Enabling the Developer Mode on Your Headset

When you first set up your headset, you must have been asked to download the Oculus app on a smartphone or tablet, and you must have synced your headset with that app.

Turn on your headset, open the Oculus app on your smartphone or tablet, select the `Menu` tab, and then select the `Devices` icon.

</p>

Your headset should be displayed there, and its status should be `Connected`.

Scroll down and click on `Developer Mode`.
